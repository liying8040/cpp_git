(1) Climbing Stairs

You are climbing a stair case. It takes *n* steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Note:** Given *n* will be a positive integer.

```
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n == 1) return 1;
        if(n == 2) return 2;
        int a = 1, b = 2, c = 0;
        int i = 3;
        while(i <= n){
            c = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = c;
            i++;
        }
        return c;
        
    }
};
```

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n == 1) return 1;
        if(n == 2) return 2;
        return climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2)   //动态规划会超时
};
```
